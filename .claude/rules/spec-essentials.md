# Spec Essentials

On every session start, read these spec files before doing anything:

1. [First Rule](../../spec/foundation/agent/first-rule.md) — spec-first, stop on gaps
2. [Writing Style](../../spec/foundation/writing-style.md) — language, tone, structure
3. [Agent Overview](../../spec/foundation/agent/overview.md) — agent compliance

Key reminders (see spec for full rules):

- **Discussion language:** Chinese, technical terms in English
- **Artifacts language:** English (spec, code, commits, docs)
- **First rule:** only do what spec defines; stop and report gaps
