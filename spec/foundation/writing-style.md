# Writing Style

These rules apply to the specification itself, code comments,
documentation, commit messages, and all written communication
within the ecosystem.

## Language

- Specification files are written in English.
- Use declarative sentence structure. State facts and rules directly.
- No emoji. No decorative formatting.

## Tone

- Formal and precise.
- Rules are stated as imperatives ("Do X", "Never Y") or declaratives ("X is required").
- Rationale follows the rule, not the other way around.

## Discussion Language

- Primary: Chinese.
- Technical terms and identifiers remain in English.
- Final written artifacts (spec files, doc comments, commit messages) are in English.
