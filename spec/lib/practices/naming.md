# Naming

Crate naming rules for the snowball ecosystem.

The full naming specification lives at the foundation level:

- [Common rules](../../foundation/naming/common.md) —
  universal conventions.
- [Crate naming](../../foundation/naming/crate.md) —
  role-specific naming.
- [File structure](../../foundation/naming/file-structure.md) —
  file and directory naming.
